# In-Memory Filesystem API (Proof of Concept)

This project is a draft proof of concept for a simple in memory filesystem API exposed over HTTP using Spark Java.  
It was originally developed as one component of a larger database project, which remains private.

It provides a basic hierarchical folder document structure entirely in memory.
It exposes a REST style API for creating, retrieving, and deleting folders and documents.
Demonstrates core file system operations without external storage or persistence.
